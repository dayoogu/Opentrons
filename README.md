🧪 Opentrons Protocols for UCL Lab Work

This repository contains Python scripts designed to control the Opentrons OT-2 liquid-handling robot for various lab protocols used at UCL. These scripts serve as educational tools for students to understand both basic and advanced automation techniques.

📁 Included Protocols

**UCL.py** – Writes "UCL" on a Corning 96-well plate using precise liquid dispensing.

**Serial Dilution.py** – Performs a standard serial dilution procedure across wells.

**Partial Column.py** – Demonstrates partial-column pipetting with custom nozzle configuration.

**AuNP Synthesis.py** – Automates the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

🌟 Highlights & Educational Value

- Designed for use with the Opentrons OT-2 robot.

- Demonstrates efficient, readable, and modular Python code structure.

- Goes beyond basic liquid transfers to include:

- Partial-column pipetting

- Push-out dispensing

- Tip washing steps

- Sustainable practices like returning tips to racks

- Introduces students to real-world lab automation and encourages green chemistry principles.

💡 These protocols are intended as starting points — students are encouraged to build on them, improve efficiency, and experiment with more complex robotic logic.
✨ Feel free to fork this repo 🍴, test the protocols 🧪, and adapt them to your own research or teaching needs 🎓🔬. Contributions and ideas are welcome 🤝!
