This Github contain code for Opentrons protocol and visualisation

Protocol 1.1: Mounting pipette and write protocol using Opentrons Protocol Designer

Protocol 1.2: Understanding how to write python code in Partial Column 
  Opentrons Python API allow users pick up single tips using single channel pipette, multiple tips using multi channel pipette, or partial tip using multi channel pipette. In protocol 1.2, users are guide to write a Python code that control the robot to use 8 channel pipette to pick up only four tips at a time. You can either run the Python code in local terminal and generate steps in the terminal, or use the code from "Convert_to_txt.py" to generate txt file of the steps in the same repository.
