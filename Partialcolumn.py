    # Now, tips_by_row is a list containing two alphabets: D and H. When calling the pipette to pick up tips, we set the location to tips_by_row.pop(0). Each time pop(0) is called, the first well in the list is removed and assigned to the pick_up_tip() function. In this case, row D is removed and assigned to pick_up_tip, asking pipette to pick up tip at D1. Remember, The pipette always picks up partial columns with its frontmost nozzles H1. So nozzel H1 will pick up tip at D1, while nozzle G1 will pick up tip at C1, and so on. As the result, we are asking pipette to pick up tips from A1-D1 of the tip rack
